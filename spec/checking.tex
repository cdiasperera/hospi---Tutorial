In both \code{hospi} and \code{spi} we check our terms in (almost) the same way, via the:
\bi
    \item \code{type-value}
    \item \code{type-term}
\ei

operators. The former provides the type for a value and the latter type-checks a process.
They both take in a context and the value / process being types. However, in \code{hospi}'s case, the context is split into the shared context $\Gamma$ and the linear / session context $\Theta$.

You have a well-typed process if reducing \code{type-term} does not return \code{ill-typed}.
