\section{Using (Higher Order) \texorpdfstring{$\pi$}{pi}-calculus in Maude}
To demonstrate the use of the specification, we have developed a series of examples for both session-typed $\pi$-calculus and for HOS$\pi$.

In each folder, there is a \texttt{examples/basic.maude} which contains examples demonstrating the basic examples for each construct.

Furthermore, there are 5 distinct example scenarios that have been implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{spi/examples/calculator}: This example involves a calculation server for boolean calculations.
    \item \texttt{spi/examples/petition}: This example involves a petition server which tracks who has signed to the petition. 
    \item \texttt{hospi/examples/calculator}: This example involves a calculation server offering both boolean and integer calculations. However this server sends code to the client who can spawn a mini server to do these calculations.
    \item \texttt{hospi/examples/petition}: This example involves a petition server that takes $n \in \mathbb{N}$ signees from a client and tracks how many people have signed up to the petition.
    \item \texttt{*/examples/api}: Both examples demonstrate an ATM system which allows for withdrawls, deposits, opening an account and checking your balance.
\end{itemize}
